# Onboarding

Make sure you have completed the following activities before the second class meeting:

1. Create a [:fontawesome-brands-google: **Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) account.
    - You can use an existing :fontawesome-brands-google: Google account or create a new one.
    - This is the main tool we will use to complete all of the courses activities.
2. Create a [:fontawesome-brands-github: **GitHub**](https://github.com/) account using your **@scpobx.fr** email.
    - This will allow you to join the chat.
4. Validate your :fontawesome-brands-github: **GitHub** account with the code received by email.
5. Join the course chat on [:fontawesome-brands-gitter: **Gitter**](https://gitter.im/ScPoBx/introduction-to-data-science) and say hi!
    - Select your newly created :fontawesome-brands-github: **GitHub** account when prompted to join the chat.
    - This is the main tool we will use to communicate.
6. Install the [:fontawesome-brands-gitter: **Gitter**](https://gitter.im/apps) app on your :octicons-device-mobile-24: and/or :fontawesome-solid-laptop:

For now, you can explore these tools by yourself. If these tools don't make sense yet do not worry. We'll cover them in the upcoming class meetings.

Other resources will continue to be added throughout the course length. You should check the resource pages regularly!
